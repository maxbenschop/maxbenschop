### Hi there 👋, my name is Max
#### I am a software developer from the Netherlands.

I'm Max, a student who loves to code and is always looking to learn something new. 💻📚 I'm passionate about software development and enjoy working on projects that challenge me to grow and expand my skill set. 

When I'm not coding, you can usually find me exploring the great outdoors 🏞️, listening to music 🎵, or reading a good book 📖. 

Thanks for stopping by my profile! If you'd like to connect or collaborate on a project, feel free to reach out. 😄
